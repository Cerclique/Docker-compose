# Docker-compose

Our docker composed of 3 services :
* **db** : MongoDB used to store our data
* **finance** : Microservice that retrieve value from yahoo-finance API. We use these data as resources for each city
* **api** : Our server built using Express and json-api.

## Build and run 
First, you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine.

After cloning the repository, simply run :

* `docker-compose up`

When all services are launched, the database will start stocking data providing by our microservice API.

You can access to the database using any adapted software (Robo 3T, Studio 3T) at this adress : `localhost:27027`.

Our API is available at `localhost:1337/api`. From this adress, you can also access to our GeneticAlgorithm API following this prototype : 
* `http://localhost:1337/algogen?start=[city]&end=[city]`

You can use any city from this list for start and end values.

* `Bordeaux`
* `Lille`
* `Lyon`
* `Marseille`
* `Nantes`
* `Paris`
* `Toulouse`

Here are more inforamation about the algorithm itself.

# Genetic Algorithm - [link](./json-api/algoGen.js)
## **Overview**

This algorithm generates a path from *depCity* to *arrCity* by maximizing the resources harvested. Here is the prototype :
```js
const algoGen = (depCity, arrCity, errorThreshold = 0.01, maxIteration = 100, nbChromosome = 15, mutationOdd = 0.1)
```
The *depCity* is not in the chromosome, but the *arrCity* is at the end of each. The size of each chromosome is random. 

## **Description**
Following are the main steps detailed :
### **Initialization**
Creation of the first parents (which their size is random from **2** to **20**).

### **Creation of children by Cross-Over**
Creation of children by **Cross-over** at a random index from each of two random parents. We just have to maintain the maximum size a chromosome can have.

### **Mutation of children**
Mutation Odd is set at 10%, but the last gene of each chromosome cannot mutate as it represents the *arrCity*.

### **Checking of chromosomes**
Some additionnal rules to have better results :
1. Never the same city(~gene) twice in a row
2. No more than twice the same city in a chromosome

### **Computing scores of chromosomes**
We mesure how many resources a truck harvest and the distance traveled. We suppose a truck have no cargo limit. Plus, a malus is applied if the distance traveled is over  *limitKM = 3000*.

### **Updating moving average**
We keep track of the score average of the last five iterations. The *error* is calculated as the difference between the current iteration and the mean of the last five averages, as percentage.

### **Selection**
The new parents are selected as the 73% best chromosomes. (Because Why not ?).

### **Iteration**
The exit condition required are both :
1. At least 5 iterations
2. An *error* < *errorThreshold = 1%*

### **Returned object**
The object returned is composed of :
* the path (from *depCity* to *arrCity* included)
* the number of resources harvested (minus the malus if there is one)
* the distance traveled
* the number of iteration
* the final error
